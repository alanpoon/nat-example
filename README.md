A programmable desk of the future which blurs the line between living and coding.

## Getting Started

I recommend you copy [this](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.cargo/config_fast_builds) into your `config.toml` for enabling fast compiling.

```bash
# Runs Desk
cargo make client
# Fixes the formatting and lint suggestions
cargo make fix
# Run the same checks as in CI
cargo make ci-check
```

## Is it any good?

Yes.
